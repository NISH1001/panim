Paradoxical ANIMation

## What?
Yes. Nothing much. Just my personal "mathematical" animation tool.
I intend to use this as a zone where my love for mathematics and coding meets. 

As Feynman said:

For me this is only possible by implementing "things" from scratch.

## So?
Yeah. For now it can render "things" like:
- L-Systems
- Rain
- Generative Arts
- Double Pendulum
- Zooming In and Out
- Random L-System
- Multiple Combined ANimation

## Animation Renedered From Panim

## TO-DO
Following are the things I have in my mind but I am too much lost in my own mind-cave that I have to find time to implement. :/

- Add PanTransformer to pan the animation scene
- Add a transformer to make old points vanish into the oblivion as redering progresses
- Add artistic animation objects like circle, rectangle
- Add the concept of camera
- Refactor project structure
